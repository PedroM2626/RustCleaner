## Overview

This appears to be an empty or newly initialized repository with no visible code, configuration files, or documentation. The repository structure and architectural decisions cannot be determined from the current contents.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

No architectural decisions can be identified from the current repository state. The system architecture will need to be established based on future development requirements and technology choices.

Key areas that will likely need architectural decisions:
- Application framework and language selection
- Data storage and management approach
- User interface and experience design
- API design and communication patterns
- Authentication and security implementation

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies, third-party services, or integrations can be identified from the current repository contents. Dependencies will be established as the project develops and specific functionality requirements are defined.

Future considerations may include:
- Database systems (potentially Postgres with Drizzle ORM)
- Authentication providers
- External APIs and services
- Frontend frameworks and libraries
- Deployment and hosting platforms
